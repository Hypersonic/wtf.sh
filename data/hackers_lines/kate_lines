Here's your class.
No, you're not in my class.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
Oh my God! He found the pool.
Think you can do better?
What the hell is going on?
If God gave men brains bigger than dogs', they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail parties.
Ruth Libby.
Her last book sold two million copies.
He's not in this class.
He's not enrolled in this class.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
I wanna triple the RAM...
What is he doing in here?
What?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
What the hell are you doing?
It's too much machine for you.
I hope you don't screw like you type.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
If I win, you become my slave.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Make it my first born.
You're not gonna win.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Alright, he's in the personal ads. "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality. Leather, lace, and water sports. Transvestites welcome."
Yeah, whatever. What's the score?
And if I win, so do you.
Oooohhhh...
Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.
You are man enough to stick with the deal, aren't you?
Hello?
Phreak?
You think they're going to bust us?
We need your help.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
Uh, hold on...
Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
What?
You what?
Why did he come to you?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
How?
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
It's my subway defense system.
Yeah, it's Kate.
Alright, so what have we got?
What oil spills?
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run. I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look... "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right, till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay? Are you coming?
There they are!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
I lost 'em. Where were you?
We need your help. If you're up to it.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us time, we have to get into Plague's file and copy the worm.
Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
Joey, take his place.
Take his place, man, do it. You can do it.
Ready?
Alright, let's boot up.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Kill the Gibson.
Let's get out of here!
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Dade.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, wow, she's great.
You would have looked better.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
Dreams?
