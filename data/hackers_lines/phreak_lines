The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I know you play the game.
Joey, Joey...
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
You know, you're right about that. Check it, Friday.
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Congratulations. No one's ever beat her before. You just made an enemy for life. Boy meets world. Let's go?
Curtis.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
What's up?
Oh my God. You...
Way cool! You saw that?
Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Yo, who ate all of my fries?
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Do you?
Nikon! Lord Nikon this is...
Come on!
Sure man, he's elite.
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
It's at Kate's...
Thought so!
Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help books for women. Stuff like "Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae"
Yo, what's up Nikon!
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
I want it to have my children!
Yo, hit the lights.
One-handed!
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Uh-huh!
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
So here's the deal. The chosen contest: To hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill, and get one back for Joey.
Use only the dialups, access codes and passwords in your collection. Can't ask for any help from us.
Any questions?
Dead?
Tie.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Yo, what's up?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.
MOM Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano. Time for school, come on.
Deja vu!
What are you waiting for, arrest me already!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
555-4202.
Thank you.
Hey, it's me.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
